# Tableau-ACME-Motor-Industries

<p>ACME Motor Industries are looking to launch a new electric model, the Tazla, and are investigating the German automobile market. </p>
<p>They provided you with a file containing the monthly number of private vehicles produced in Germany, the number of vehicles exported as well as the number of new German car registrations for the period 2008 to 2016. In support of their investigation, they have asked you to assist them in creating the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>Create a quarterly trend analysis to show the relationship of number of vehicles produced versus number of vehicles exported, including trend lines per measure.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Onto the same graph created above, include a trend analysis of the number of vehicles left for over after export, for the German market. Once again include a trend line and use a bar chart.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Create a time series graph of the percentage of vehicles exported, with labels only at the maximum and minimum values. Label to contain the percentage as well as the specific month.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Format the y-axis on graph to have major tick marks every 10% and minor tick marks 5%, whilst adding the applicable grid line formatting.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Using a line chart, investigate the relationship of production versus the actual number of German cars being registered quarter by quarter, and provide some feedback to the team lead.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Create a monthly trend analysis of the percentage of German vehicles registered, adding an annual average to the graph.</li>
</ol>
